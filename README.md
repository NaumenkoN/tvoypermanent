# Purpouse
This is the first website I made myself. It was made by order of one of my friends.

# About the development of this project

This is a typical landing page website written in HTTL, CSS and JavaScript. Smooth scrolling is implemented here by pressing various buttons. Smooth appearance of different sections of the site as you scroll down the site. Sticky navbar. A module with a photo gallery and a couple of modal windows with contacts and registration for procedures. It should be noted that the registration itself is not real, since this is a serverless static website.

# Conclusion

Despite the simplicity of the idea, its implementation gave me good practical experience in development. And although these are only the first steps, it is good if these steps are in the right direction. The client was satisfied.




# Getting Started

For starting you need just to run "live server" extention or similar.
