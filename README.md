# Idea

Since I started learning web development, I needed to create my own projects to practice my acquired skills in HTTL, CSS and JavaScript. And since I love to travel and create photo and video content, it was decided to make a website where I could publish my material.<br/>

# About the development of this project

Website development is quite simple in its implementation. I used native JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The site contains several main pages such as: home, about me and the page of all the countries I visited, where by clicking on a specific country, you can see photos and video material from the corresponding country. The photos are posted locally on the hosting, and for the video I used a link from YouTube. To view photos, a beautiful slider was implemented, as well as a local language change using JavaScript. I used an image as a background and of course I regretted it many times, since it had a lot of problems and on small screens I implemented a gradient on some pages. I tried to make it as responsive as possible according to the most popular breakpoints, but on some pages, in some points you can still see imperfections.
